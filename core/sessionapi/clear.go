// THE FIRST REQUEST ON THIS API THAT CHANGES ANYTHING, and the API is unauthenticated, so what it
// guards against is a browser: a page the user visits that targets the loopback port, directly
// or through a DNS name rebound to 127.0.0.1. Four guards, each closing one route:
//
//  1. DELETE only, by the route pattern. A cross-site DELETE needs a CORS preflight, which this
//     server never approves; a simple cross-site POST needs none, which is why this is not POST.
//  2. The Host must be a loopback name. A rebound name reaches the port with its own name in Host.
//  3. No Origin header. Browsers send one, on every cross-origin request and every DELETE;
//     agentop and curl do not.
//  4. Only when allowed, which is only on a loopback-only laptop install. No new setting: a
//     cluster sidecar's API is reached through port-forwards and shared by whoever can reach it.
