// Package sessionevent builds the parts of a session event that every
// listener should record identically.
//
// It exists because the four recorders that emit a phase:"denied" event — one
// per direction per listener — grew apart from the same copy-pasted body.
// extproc recorded Plugins, Identity and Duration on both directions; the
// reverse proxy recorded TLS and none of those three; the forward proxy
// recorded none of the four. So an operator reading /v1/sessions saw a
// different event shape depending on which listener served the request, and
// which fields were populated was a property of the serving listener rather
// than of the request — the one thing a parity suite exists to prevent.
//
// Every field is derived from pctx and is absent when pctx does not carry it,
// so a listener that cannot know something records nothing for it rather than
// a zero that reads as a real value.

// dir is a parameter rather than read from pctx.Direction because the
// recorders are already one-per-direction and several of their unit tests
// construct a bare pctx with no Direction set. Reading it from pctx would
// relabel those events silently — Inbound is the zero value — which is a
// worse failure than passing the constant the caller already knows.
//
// The caller keeps two decisions. Whether to record at all: a deny from a
// plugin that appended no Invocation carries no attribution, and a
// content-free denial event is noise. And which session bucket to append to:
// that genuinely differs per listener, inbound keying on the A2A contextId
// while outbound inherits the most-recently-updated session.
