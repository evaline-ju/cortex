// Cleared implements session.Clearer: every figure answerable by session id goes — each
// session's own ring, and the session breakdown of the all-sessions ring and of every agent's.
// Everything else stays, including the all-sessions and per-agent totals, which name no session.
// They are the figures the cost ledger keeps on disk too, and a clear does not touch that.
//
// pending stays as well. It is keyed by request id and holds plugin names, not content: dropping
// it would only misattribute the plugins of a request in flight across the clear.
