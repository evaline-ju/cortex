# release_smoke_test_linux.sh — the Linux half of the release smoke test (#957).
#
# Exercises install.sh (and the agentop setup it hands off to) + agentop service
# exactly as a real user would, against
# a real published release: fresh install, upgrade over an existing install
# (config preserved, and the NEW binary actually serving), a no-op re-run, and
# a clean uninstall. Run against a real tag/release, not a local build — there
# is no supported "install from this on-disk tarball" mode in install.sh, so
# this always downloads for real.
#
# Usage: release_smoke_test_linux.sh <tag-under-test> [triggering-commit-sha]
# The sha is only needed for a main-latest run, to anchor the post-upgrade
# version check to the exact commit that triggered this run rather than
# whatever main-latest happens to point at by the time the check executes.
#
# Deliberately NOT covered here: driving a real request through the proxy and
# asserting a parsed event with a non-zero token count (#957's third bullet).
# That needs the unattended/headless capture path from #955, which does not
# exist yet — tracked there, not attempted here.

# — so an `exit` here would skip that call site's own `then` branch (which
# prints the captured output for diagnosis) entirely, leaving a bare red CI
# run with the failure message trapped in a file nobody prints. `return`
# propagates the failure to the caller instead, which every call site (both
# the bare ones under `set -e` and the one under `if !`) handles correctly.
