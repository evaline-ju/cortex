"""Dump Cortex in-memory session data to files via the session API.

STOPGAP. Durable session storage is tracked in rossoctl/cortex#901 ("persist
sessions"), which will have the proxy write sessions itself rather than depending
on someone running this first. Prefer commenting on #901 over growing this script.

The session store is in memory only -- nothing survives a proxy restart. This
walks the read APIs on listener.session_api_addr (127.0.0.1:47601 in the
laptop preset) and writes what is currently resident to disk.

What "currently resident" means depends on the `session:` config block
(core/config/config.go). With the defaults, session.max_sessions is 100 and
least-recently-updated sessions are evicted past that; max_events and ttl are
unlimited, so individual sessions are not trimmed. A dump is still a
point-in-time snapshot: a restart or an eviction loses what it did not capture.

Layout under --out:
    sessions.json               the /v1/sessions index
    usage.json                  /v1/usage aggregates
    pipeline.json, plugins.json active pipeline + plugin catalog
    sessions/<id>.jsonl         one JSON event per line, ascending seq

Examples:
    ./cortex-session-dump.py                    # all sessions, summary view
    ./cortex-session-dump.py --full             # include request/response bodies
    ./cortex-session-dump.py --session <id> --full
    ./cortex-session-dump.py --active           # only sessions marked active

See docs/session-dump.md for the field reference and the privacy note on --full.
