// Every socket is bound before anything on disk is opened, and that ordering is the point.
//
// The ports are what stop two proxies running one config, and a laptop's two proxies share
// ~/.cortex: the cost ledger and the session archive. Opening those is not read-only — the
// archive removes its trash and prunes on open, and is closed on the fatal path — so a
// second proxy that only met a taken port after opening them was writing files the running
// one was writing. That happened on every restart that outlived launchd's exit timeout:
// the old proxy was orphaned on its ports, and each new one replayed segments it had not
// finished (incompleteSegments=11) before dying on the bind. Bound first, a second proxy
// gives up before it has touched anything.
//
// It also turns the startup replay of the archive into a wait rather than a refusal: the
// kernel accepts connections on a bound socket nobody is serving yet, so a client that
// arrives during those seconds is answered late instead of refused.
