// and this reader, and core cannot import tui, so the definition had to move there —

// there are the SAME type, so every consumer in this package keeps its own spelling and
// assigns what the harvester returns with no conversion.

// keep the viewer from opening — the viewer being the tool you reach for when
// everything else is broken. Every failure yields an empty map: the pane still works, it
// just cannot name anything FROM HERE.
//
// AND THE COLUMN NO LONGER GOES BLANK WITH IT. This used to say a failure "renders as an
// empty TITLE column", which stopped being true when sessionTitleFor gained the fallback
// to the title /v1/sessions serves: a session the proxy has named still renders one
// through a total load failure. Degrading to none is therefore less visible than it was,
// which is the right direction and worth stating so the silence stays justified.
//
// Absent is not a failure at all. Nobody has this file until they run
// `agentop experimental read-claude-sessions`, so a first run must be silent rather than
// scolded.
//
// Silent on a corrupt file rather than warning, unlike loadUserConfig: that one reports
// a broken settings file because the user WROTE it and their edit is being ignored.
// This file is machine-generated, so the actionable answer is to re-run the harvester,

	// it. 16 MiB is far past any real metadata file: the measured 109-session file is 42 KB.
	//
	// READ ONE PAST THE CAP, and bail on over-cap rather than decoding. Without the +1 the file
	// was read to exactly the cap and the truncated buffer handed to Unmarshal, and what that
	// produced depended on where the cut landed. Measured both ways:
	//
	//   - Cut mid-token, the common case: Unmarshal fails with "unexpected end of JSON input"
	//     and the result is this same empty map. No behaviour change from the fix.
	//   - Cut where the prefix is INDEPENDENTLY VALID JSON — trailing whitespace past the cap
	//     does it — the prefix decoded and this function returned a PARTIAL map as though it
	//     were the whole file, while claude.ReadMetadata refused the identical bytes. A
	//     16,777,238-byte file loaded 1 entry before the fix and 0 after.

// you choose a session FROM, which gains a row whenever a new session appears and cannot
// name it without re-reading the transcripts.
//
// KEYED OFF TRAFFIC, not off a wall clock. A session with events has a transcript being
// appended to, so a harvest triggered by its own updates arrives seconds after the title
// becomes readable instead of minutes later. The settle delay is what makes
// this cheap: without it every event on a still-unnamed session would trigger a scan, and
// with it a busy session is harvested once, after it pauses.
//
// Only sessions the metadata does NOT name are considered, so a fully-harvested list triggers
// nothing at all.
//
// "FULLY HARVESTED" IS NOT "EVERY ROW NAMED ON SCREEN", and this comment used to conflate the two.
// sessionHasTitle asks about the HARVEST only — sessionTitleFor's served-title fallback is
// deliberately invisible to it (see sessionTitle's doc for why) — so a row showing a proxy-derived
// title still counts as untitled here and keeps triggering settled harvests. For an agent with no
// Claude Code transcript tree on this disk those harvests can never succeed, so that is not a
// transient state on the way to quiet: it is the permanent one, and the allocation noted below is
// paid for as long as the pane is open. Bounded by untitledBackoffCap (~3m between attempts) rather
// than by ever being satisfied. That periodic scan is the accepted price of not letting a served
// title stop the search for the richer harvested one; it is not a leak, but it is not free either.
//
// THE QUIET TEST SPANS TWO CLOCKS and tolerates them disagreeing in the safe direction; the
// reasoning is at the comparison itself.
//
// IT IS NOT FREE, THOUGH, and an earlier version of this comment claimed "one map lookup per row
// per tick", which undersells it: sessionHasTitle goes through sessionTitle, which calls
// sanitizeLabel, which builds a new string. So the steady state allocates once per resident row
// per 2s tick and always walks the whole list — the all-titled case is the one that cannot exit
// early, because the loop is looking for a row that is not there.
//
// Left as a linear walk deliberately. The rows that cost anything here are one pod's live
// sessions, a handful in practice against the ~180 in the metadata file: with a session archive
// the list also holds every session the archive keeps — ~2,000 over thirty days — but
// awaitsHarvest skips those archive-only rows before the allocating sessionHasTitle call, so each
// of them costs a pointer check. And the alternative — a cached "any untitled" flag — is a second
// piece of state to invalidate on every sessionsLoadedMsg and every harvest merge, which is how
// the events map grew the bugs its own comments now document. The honest figure is in the

// answers blank here and the cell shows the served title instead, or "" when there is none. What
// remains NOT a blankness test is sessionTitleCell's own `title == ""` fast path, which only skips
// truncating an empty string and is reached after this predicate has already had its say.

// renders sessionTitleFor, which is sanitizeLabel'd on both paths, and nothing trims afterwards.

// "\n" is NOT blank here — the cell shows "�", a visible glyph, and a predicate calling that row
// unnamed would re-harvest forever for a row that is already displaying something.
//
// Reversing the two — sanitizeLabel(TrimSpace(title)) — is the tempting reading, since it makes
// "\t" answer "blank" the way a human skimming the source expects. It is wrong for this
// predicate: TrimSpace would strip the tab before sanitizeLabel could turn it into the glyph the
// cell actually paints, so the predicate would disagree with the screen. That disagreement is the
// one thing this helper exists to prevent. (Only tab/newline-class runes differ between the two
// orders; NUL and the BIDI controls are not whitespace, so TrimSpace never reaches them.)

// Sanitising a string sessionTitle already sanitised is a no-op, not a second pass with different
// meaning: sanitizeLabel is idempotent — U+FFFD matches none of its cases and falls through — so
// the caller does not have to know which of the two paths got there first.
//
// IDEMPOTENT IS NOT FREE, THOUGH, which is why blankSanitized exists beside this. sanitizeLabel
// builds a new string with b.Grow(len(s)) on the UNTRUNCATED input, so a caller already holding one
// and calling this anyway allocates a second full copy to reach the same answer. On the render path
